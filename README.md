### **Day 1 — Orientation & Department Visit (27/10/2025)**

**Objective:** Introduction to Pinnacle Fiber Pvt. Ltd. and its production process.

**What I did:**

* Attended **orientation session** and **safety briefing**.
* Visited all major departments to understand the company’s workflow:

  * Feeding Section
  * Dry Trommel
  * Sorting Area
  * Washing Department
  * Crushing Section
  
* Observed how each section is interconnected in the **PET bottle recycling process**.

**🧠 Learning Outcome:**
Gained a clear overview of the complete **PET recycling cycle**, from **raw bottle feeding to final fiber production**.

### **Day 2 — Washing Department (28/10/2025)**

**Topic:** Bottle Cleaning and Preparation for Crushing

**What I learned:**

* **Label Scraper & Label Blower:** Machines used to remove and blow off bottle labels.
* **Pre-Wash & Manual Sorting:** Removing leftover labels, caps, and impurities by hand.
* Understood the **4 major washing steps:**

  1. Segregation
  2. Sorting
  3. Washing
  4. Crushing
* **Crushing Section:** Learned how bottles are converted into **uniform PET flakes** for further processing.

**🧠 Learning Outcome:**
Understood the complete **bottle-to-flake preparation** process before fiber production.

### **Day 3 — Baler Section (29/10/2025)**

**Topic:** Understanding Baler Machine Operation and Electrical Automation

**Machine Details:**

* 2 × **55 kW Hydraulic Motors** (Main press operation)
* 1 × **4 kW Oil Motor** (Hydraulic oil circulation)
* 2 × **22 kW Feeding Motors** (Material feeding)
* Controlled through **PLC** and **HMI (Weigh-Tronix System)**
* Includes multiple sensors: **Proximity, Limit, Ramp, and Trolley sensors** for auto operation
* One bale weight: **250–280 kg** (≈8 cycles per bale)

**What I observed and learned:**

* Understood **how PLC controls automatic sequence** of the baler machine using sensor feedback.
* Observed operation of **hydraulic and feeding motors** during each cycle.
* Learned the function of **proximity sensors** and how they detect bale positioning.
* Studied how **Weigh-Tronix system** integrates with PLC for weighing accuracy.
* Observed issues like **negative weight readings** and the process of **sensor recalibration**.

### **My Contribution as a Trainee Electrical Engineer**

* Assisted in **checking motor load current** using clamp meter.
* Verified **sensor wiring and feedback signals** during auto cycle.
* Helped in **fault diagnosis** (negative weight issue and sensor alignment).
* Ensured **safety interlocks, limit switches, and emergency stop** buttons were functional.
* Recorded readings and updated **motor maintenance log**.

**🧠 Learning Outcome:**
Developed practical understanding of **electrical drives, automation, PLC control, and sensor-based systems** used in industrial machinery.
Gained experience in **troubleshooting, calibration, and electrical safety**.
# Day 4 Progress Report

## 1. Learning Activity – Forward & Reverse Contactor Circuit

Today I studied and practiced the **Forward and Reverse Contactor Control Circuit**, which is used to change the rotation direction of a three-phase motor.

### **a) Forward Operation**

* Contactor **K1** energizes to run the motor in forward direction.
* Used **NO (13–14)** contact for self-holding.
* Understood the control path: **S1 → S2 → K2 (NC) → K1 coil**.

### **b) Reverse Operation**

* Contactor **K2** energizes to run the motor in reverse direction.
* Used **NO (13–14)** contact for holding.
* Understood the path: **S1 → S3 → K1 (NC) → K2 coil**.

### **c) Electrical Interlocking**

* **K2 NC** contact is placed in the Forward line.
* **K1 NC** contact is placed in the Reverse line.
* Prevents both contactors from energizing at the same time, protecting against phase short-circuit.

### **d) Circuit Drawing**

* I created a hand-drawn control wiring diagram.
* Corrected the NC contact positions to ensure safe and correct operation.

## 2. Maintenance Activity – CPF Sleeve Ultrasonic Machine

### **Issue Reported:**

The **CPF Sleeve Ultrasonic machine** was not showing temperature and the heating section was not working.

### **Action Taken:**

* Visited the machine area with **Technician Uzair**.
* Checked temperature controller, power supply, heating module, and sensor wiring.
* Found the **temperature sensor connection loose**, causing no temperature reading.
* Reconnected the wiring and reset the controller.

### **Result:**

* Temperature reading restored.
* Heating and ultrasonic function working normally.
* Machine handed over in proper working condition.

Overall Week 1 Summary

During the first week, I observed and learned about each stage of PET recycling, from bottle feeding to final bale formation. I developed a foundational understanding of industrial process flow, automation, and electrical systems used in modern recycling plants. This week strengthened my awareness of how electrical engineering supports continuous industrial production.
