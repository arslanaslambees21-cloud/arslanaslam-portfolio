### **Day 1 — Orientation & Department Visit (27/10/2025)**

**Objective:** Introduction to Pinnacle Fiber Pvt. Ltd. and its production process.

**What I did:**

* Attended **orientation session** and **safety briefing**.
* Visited all major departments to understand the company’s workflow:

  * Feeding Section
  * Dry Trommel
  * Sorting Area
  * Washing Department
  * Crushing Section
  
* Observed how each section is interconnected in the **PET bottle recycling process**.

**🧠 Learning Outcome:**
Gained a clear overview of the complete **PET recycling cycle**, from **raw bottle feeding to final fiber production**.

### **Day 2 — Washing Department (28/10/2025)**

**Topic:** Bottle Cleaning and Preparation for Crushing

**What I learned:**

* **Label Scraper & Label Blower:** Machines used to remove and blow off bottle labels.
* **Pre-Wash & Manual Sorting:** Removing leftover labels, caps, and impurities by hand.
* Understood the **4 major washing steps:**

  1. Segregation
  2. Sorting
  3. Washing
  4. Crushing
* **Crushing Section:** Learned how bottles are converted into **uniform PET flakes** for further processing.

**🧠 Learning Outcome:**
Understood the complete **bottle-to-flake preparation** process before fiber production.

### **Day 3 — Baler Section (29/10/2025)**

**Topic:** Understanding Baler Machine Operation and Electrical Automation

**Machine Details:**

* 2 × **55 kW Hydraulic Motors** (Main press operation)
* 1 × **4 kW Oil Motor** (Hydraulic oil circulation)
* 2 × **22 kW Feeding Motors** (Material feeding)
* Controlled through **PLC** and **HMI (Weigh-Tronix System)**
* Includes multiple sensors: **Proximity, Limit, Ramp, and Trolley sensors** for auto operation
* One bale weight: **250–280 kg** (≈8 cycles per bale)

**What I observed and learned:**

* Understood **how PLC controls automatic sequence** of the baler machine using sensor feedback.
* Observed operation of **hydraulic and feeding motors** during each cycle.
* Learned the function of **proximity sensors** and how they detect bale positioning.
* Studied how **Weigh-Tronix system** integrates with PLC for weighing accuracy.
* Observed issues like **negative weight readings** and the process of **sensor recalibration**.

### **My Contribution as a Trainee Electrical Engineer**

* Assisted in **checking motor load current** using clamp meter.
* Verified **sensor wiring and feedback signals** during auto cycle.
* Helped in **fault diagnosis** (negative weight issue and sensor alignment).
* Ensured **safety interlocks, limit switches, and emergency stop** buttons were functional.
* Recorded readings and updated **motor maintenance log**.

**🧠 Learning Outcome:**
Developed practical understanding of **electrical drives, automation, PLC control, and sensor-based systems** used in industrial machinery.
Gained experience in **troubleshooting, calibration, and electrical safety**.
